TODO:

- use bootstrap to make the website look good
	-basic as in the book, but nice fonts, and borders and stuff. Maybe a nice rotating header image.
	-limit the character amount in the mongoDB query for lists
		-create a view that limits the characters???

-put login credentials somewhere else, so I can push to github, without revealing credentials...
- make a blog post and post on G+ about how long it took.

future:
- consider using underscore for a lot of basic js functionality that i've reproduced.
